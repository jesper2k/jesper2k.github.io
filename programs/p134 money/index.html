        <br>
        <p>
            Investing can be a very easy way of making money without putting in a lot of work, relative to your standard job.
            However, it can lead to losses if you're unlucky or make a big mistake.
        </p>
        <p>
            These are my thoughts on investing based on cool math and statistics, and what i think is useful to know when doing it.<br>
        </p>
            <br>

                This is not financial advice or whatever, your decisions are your responsibility.
                I have no idea how the stock market works, i just watch lines go up or down and make decisions based on their history.
                These are only my thoughts based on math and stuff. Don't sue me for your own dumb decisions.

        <p>These examples are based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBX-KulgJ1o" target="_blank">this video</a> by Veritasium</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Expected value</h3>
        <p>
            This is an example of how i think about betting money, and it's very useful for understanding the risks and rewards of making investments.<br>
            <br>
            Let's say i make a bet with you. I will toss a perfect coin with a 50% chance of landing on a either it's green or red face.
            If it lands on red (red facing up) you give me $10, and if it lands on green (green facing up) i give you $15, $5 more than i have to pay if i win the bet.<br>
            <br>
            Do you take the bet? Why or why not?<br>
            <br>
            Your first intutive thought may be "well there's a 50% chance that i lose $10, and while i could make $15, i'm not willing to take that risk".<br>
            <br>
            Now let's do the math:<br>
            50% of the times i do this bet, you'll win $15<br>
            the other 50%, you lose $10<br>
            
            <div class="block math">
                Expected value:<br>
                <code>$15 * 50% - $10 * 50%<br>
                    = + $2.5</code><br><br>
                So on average, you'd be up $2.5
            </div>
            
            Now if you had $1000 you could take this bet without any significant risk, because you could only lose 1% of what you have, and on average you'll make money doing the bet.<br>
            <br>
        </p>

        <h3>Risk</h3>
        <p>
            Now let's change the bet to my reward being $1000$ and your reward being $1500.
            While sure, you would on average win $250, you also have a 50% chance of losing everything you own.
            That's a huge risk, and it's not a very good bet in this situation.<br>
            <br>
        </p>

        <h3>Repeated bets</h3>
        <p>
            Here's my last bet; it's the same as the first $15/$10 one, but you have to do it 100 times.
            You can simulate this by clicking the button, and you can click it several times to see what you usually win or lose.<br><br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; <button id="bet_button">Bet!</button> &nbsp; &nbsp; Your reward: <span id="bet_result">_____</span><br><br>
            The total expected value for 100 bets would be 100 * $2.5 = $250.
            You'll probably have to click the button a few times to even see a losing bet.
            Most (~96.5%) of the time, you'll win 40 to 60 of the bets.
            If you win fewer than 40 of the bets (~1.75%), you lose money, but if you win more than 60 of them (also ~1.75%), you win more than 500$.
            While you could thoretically lose every single bet and lose all your $1000, it's astronomically unlikely.
            <br><br>
        </p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            But who cares? why am i telling you this?<br><br>
            Because it relates to how you can strategically invest your own money to minimize your risk of losing it while still making a reasonable gain.
            Even though all of these bets have the same win/loss value of 1.5 to 1, they show how you can strategically come out of the bet with a profit without taking much risk.<br><br>
            Making repeated bets is mostly analogous to investing in different independent things. Although, in reality this isn't quite the case, as a lot of stocks move similarly from day to day.
            Also, making the largest gain will come at the cost of the largest risk of losing it all.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        That's it for now!
        I might add some more stuff here later about things like:
        <ul>
            <li>inflation</li>
            <li>investing over time</li>
            <li>How to (mostly) avoid paying taxes on your gains</li>
        </ul>
